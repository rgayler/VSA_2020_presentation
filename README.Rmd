Create the presentation, "VSA, Analogy, and Dynamic Similarity", to be given 
at the [Workshop on Developments in Hyperdimensional Computing and Vector Symbolic Architectures](https://sites.google.com/view/vsaworkshop2020/home)
on 2020-03-16
in Heidelberg, Germany.
This event is associated with the [8th Annual Neuro-Inspired Computational Elements (NICE) Workshop](https://niceworkshop.org/nice-2020/).

The primary purpose of this repository is to archive the source code for creating the presentation.
The secondary purpose is to document the process of creating and running the project,
in the hope that it will save me some time for the next presentation project.

## Project setup

This assumes starting with everything that's on my computer right now.
Your mileage *will* vary
(in particular, you may have to install a bunch of R packages).

1. Make sure `usethis` is installed
and follow the [setup instructions](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html) 
so that user name and other details are set up ready for the project.

1. Create empty GitHub repo `VSA_2020_presentation`
using these [instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#make-a-repo-on-github-2).

1. Create a local RStudio project by cloning the GitHub repo
using these [instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#new-rstudio-project-via-git-clone).

1. Create a `past_pres` and a `figs` subdirectory of the new project
because I anticipate using a lot past presentations and copying pages out of them 
to use as figures in the current presentation.

1. Guard against leaking credentials to GitHub.
This only needs to be done once per user/computer
but does no harm to be repeated for each new project.  
    ```
    usethis::git_vaccinate()
    ```

1. Activate `renv` package tracking.  
    ```
    renv::init()
    ```  
    This starts the project with an empty library,
    so all the infrastructure will have to be installed as it is first used.
    You will use `renv::install()` a lot,
    in particular, you will have to install `usethis` into the project.

1. Install `usethis` to the project and mark the project as using `usethis`
(updates the project-specific `.Rprofile`).  
    ```
    renv::install("usethis")  
    usethis::use_usethis()
    ```

1. Copy README.Rmd (this document) from a prior GitHub linked project
and edit it to explain what this project is about and how it was set up.
Keep this up to date as the project progresses.
See [GitHub document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html)
for instructions on the contents for this kind of README to be rendered on GitHub.

1. Set the license.  
    ```
    usethis::use_ccby_license()
    ```  
    Add the appropriate license badge from [lukas-h/license-badges.md](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) to README.Rmd.

1. Commit, push, rinse, and repeat as the project progresses.
Follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#make-local-changes-save-commit-1).

## Write presentation

1. Copy in resources from previous projects to use as a starting point.  
  * VSA2020_Gayler_abstract.pdf # submitted extended abstract of presentation
  * scorecal_CSCC_2019 / scorecal_CSCC_2019.Rmd # use as template for current presentation
  * scorecal_CSCC_2019 / by.png # CC-BY logo
  * old presentations

1. Write presentation, copying figures from prior documents as needed

1. Render presentation (how???)

## Clean up and publish

1. Remove any documents not used in current presentation.

2. Publish to github (how???)

3. Publish to Zenodo ???
